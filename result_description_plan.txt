1. What the NAT should do (RFC tra-la-la)

2. What is the core functionality (CHECK SUM etc.)

3. What to achive - target characteristics - rostelecom, rdp.ru

4. How to achieve - what is the main problem - the main problem is lookup data structure

5. Plan on what to test: linear, tree, tree-array, rb-tree(balanced) array, hash, parallel

6. Test program description (what is the bottle neck, what does it do, how much does it cost)

7. Performance comparison (packets per second, memory usage, limitation)

	7.1 Base line
 
	7.2 Linear

	7.3 Tree

		7.3.1 Tree-tree

		7.3.2 Tree - plain array

		7.3.3 RB-tree - plain array

	7.4 Hash+array

	7.5 Parallel hash+array

		7.5.1 Size
		
		7.5.2 Cores

8. Summary
